## Project Overview

This project demonstrates:

- **HTML** for building the structure of the web pages.
  
- **CSS** for styling and improving the visual layout.
  
- **JavaScript** for adding interactivity and dynamic elements.
  
- **JSON-Server** as a lightweight way to mock backend functionality, allowing us to create, read, update, and delete data without a full backend setup.

## Features

- Interactive, responsive user interface.
  
- Dynamic content fetching and display.
  
- CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using JSON-Server.
  
- Basic form handling and data validation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (for running JSON-Server)
  
- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   
2. Navigate to the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

3. Install JSON-Server:

   ```bash
   npm install -g json-server
   ```

4. Start JSON-Server:

   ```bash
   json-server --watch db.json
   ```

This will start a server at http://localhost:3000.

## Usage

1. Open index.html in your browser to view the website.
   
2. Use the provided features to interact with the site. JSON-Server will handle all data-related actions, simulating a backend.
   
## Project Structure

- index.html: Contains the basic structure of the web pages.

- styles.css: Contains the styles for the layout and visual elements.

- script.js: Contains JavaScript for handling user interactions and data updates.

- db.json: Acts as a mock database for JSON-Server.
